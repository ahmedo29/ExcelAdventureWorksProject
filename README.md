# Adventure Works Project

## Description
I completed several dashboards for a company called 'Adventure Works', who sell a variety of sporting products such as several types of bikes, sports clothing, and several more. This project involves extracting, profiling, and analysing the Adventure Works data. The focus of this project was to create a four dashboards, this projects aims to provide insightful visualisations for better undertsanding and interpretation of the data. The four dashboards created were:
	- Products Dashboard
	- Countries Dashboard
	- Customers Dashboard
	- Customer Information Dashboard

## Installation
Cleaned Data, Analysed Data, and the Dashboard:
	Adventure Works Dashboard

All of the cleaned and analysed data is in this Excel file.

## Process
Data Importation: I downloaded all of the raw data from Kaggle, and then imported it all into Microsoft Excel

Data Cleaning: I then formatted all the data into tables, making sure all the columns are in the correct formats, that there is no missing data, there is no duplicated data which is not needed, and corrected any errors and inconsistencies within the data. 

Data Analysis: I analysed the data to create useful insights, such as the total sales per product, which countries generated the most sales, total sales by gender , and several other insights. I did this by using a range of data analysis skills, such as VLookups, Excel Functions, and Pivot Tables. 

Data Visualisations: I used the pivot tables to then create insightful visualiations to show a range of insights in the dashboards I created.
